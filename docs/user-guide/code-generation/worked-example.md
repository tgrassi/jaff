# Worked Example

This page works through an example of how to use JAFF to auto-generate a
chemistry network that can be integrated as part of an external hydro code. In
this toy example, we will use a tiny network and a C++ template file that is
self-contained rather than part of a larger hydro code, but that can still be
compiled to produce a program that integrates the chemistry in time.

The layout mirrors the way things work in production. A real target code already
owns its ODE-integration infrastructure — solvers, time-stepping, drivers — in
its own files; JAFF only supplies a generated file holding the right-hand side
(RHS) and Jacobian of the network along with other required properties.
So the example is split across three files:

| File             | Who writes it              | Role                                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `chem_rhs.hpp`   | **JAFF**, from the network | the generated RHS and Jacobian         |
| `integrator.hpp` | you (the host code)        | a generic backward-Euler solver        |
| `main.cpp`       | you (the host code)        | the driver that wires the two together |

The mental model is the only thing to hold onto: **a template is ordinary source
code; every line is copied to the output verbatim except the `$JAFF` blocks,
which are expanded against the network.** The
[Template Syntax](template-syntax.md) page is the
full directive reference; this page just puts the pieces together.

---

## 1. The network

For this simple example, we will create a new, toy network, which consists of
only two species and two reactions: hydrogen atoms forming H₂ and H₂ breaking
back apart. Save it as `toy.jet`:

```text
# Toy H2 formation/dissociation network (PRIZMO format)
# columns:  reaction  [tmin,tmax]  rate-coefficient(tgas)
H + H -> H2     []   1.00e-10*(tgas/3e2)**(-0.5)
H2 -> H + H     []   2.00e-9*exp(-1.0e2/tgas)
```

Both rates are plain functions of the gas temperature `tgas`, so the generated
code is self-contained — no photochemistry, cosmic-ray, or extinction symbols to
supply at runtime. Species are indexed in load order: `H` is `0`, `H2` is `1`.

---

## 2. The template

The template produces **only** the network-specific code: the species/reaction
counts, the ODE right-hand side, and the analytic Jacobian. There is no solver
and no `main` here — those belong to the host code (sections 4 and 5). The
output is a header the rest of the program `#include`s. Save it as `chem_rhs.hpp`.
The `$JAFF` blocks are the only generated regions — everything else is C++ copied
through untouched.

```cpp
// chem_rhs.hpp — a JAFF template.
// Every line is plain C++ copied verbatim, except the $JAFF blocks, which JAFF
// fills in from the network. The output is a header the host code #includes.
#pragma once
#include <cmath>

// $JAFF SUB nspec, nreact
constexpr int NSPEC  = $nspec$;
constexpr int NREACT = $nreact$;
// $JAFF END

// dn/dt for every species. nden = number densities (cm^-3), tgas = K.
inline void derivatives(const double* nden, double tgas, double* f) {
    // $JAFF REPEAT idx, ode IN odes
    f[$idx$] = $ode$;
    // $JAFF END
}

// Analytic Jacobian J[i][j] = d f[i] / d nden[j]. Only the non-zero entries are
// generated; the rest stay zero from the clear loop.
inline void jacobian(const double* nden, double tgas, double** J) {
    for (int i = 0; i < NSPEC; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < NSPEC; ++j) J[i][j] = 0.0;
    // $JAFF REPEAT idx, expr IN jacobian
    J[$idx$][$idx$] = $expr$;
    // $JAFF END
}
```

Three directives carry the whole template:

- **`SUB nspec, nreact`** swaps the `$nspec$` / `$nreact$` tokens for the counts.
- **`REPEAT idx, ode IN odes`** emits one `f[$idx$] = $ode$;` line per species,
  filling `$idx$` with the species index and `$ode$` with the full
  dn/dt expression. The
  [`odes`](template-syntax.md#expression-generating-collections)
  collection inlines the rate coefficients, so the rates never need a separate
  array here.
- **`REPEAT idx, expr IN jacobian`** emits the analytic Jacobian. It is a 2D
  collection, so the body carries two `$idx$` tokens (row, then column) and one
  `$expr$`. JAFF differentiates the ODEs symbolically and writes only the
  **non-zero** `J[i][j]` entries — which is why the function clears `J` to zero
  first. The implicit solver in section 4 needs this matrix; an explicit method
  would not.

The Jacobian is written into a 2D array passed as `double** J`, indexed
`J[i][j]`. The double-pointer form carries no compile-time size, so the
integrator in section 4 can allocate `J` at runtime from the `nspec` it is given
and stay completely network-independent — it never has to know `NSPEC`. The
generated code uses `NSPEC` only as the loop bound when it clears `J`, since here
it is the file that owns that constant.

The comment token (`//`) is read from the `.hpp` extension; JAFF recognises a
directive only when a line begins with it immediately followed by `$JAFF`. The
generated code uses the names `nden` and `tgas`, so the host code below speaks
the same names — no remapping needed.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! tip "Renaming JAFF's symbols"
    To target a codebase that calls the density array `y` and the temperature
    `T`, add a `REPLACE` modifier instead of renaming by hand:
    `#!text // $JAFF REPEAT idx, ode IN odes $[REPLACE nden y REPLACE tgas T]$`.
    See [REPLACE](template-syntax.md#replace-directive).

---

## 3. Generate

Run `jaffgen` over the template, pointing it at the network:

```bash
jaffgen --network toy.jet --files chem_rhs.hpp --outdir generated/
```

```text
INFO     Network loaded successfully!
INFO     chem_rhs.hpp created at .../generated
INFO     Successfully generated files
```

The expanded file keeps its name and lands in `generated/chem_rhs.hpp`. The
directive lines survive in the output (as comments), with the generated content
spliced in beneath them:

```cpp
// $JAFF SUB nspec, nreact
constexpr int NSPEC  = 2;
constexpr int NREACT = 2;
// $JAFF END

// dn/dt for every species. nden = number densities (cm^-3), tgas = K.
inline void derivatives(const double* nden, double tgas, double* f) {
    // $JAFF REPEAT idx, ode IN odes
    f[0] = -3.4641016151377544e-9*std::pow(tgas, -0.5)*std::pow(nden[0], 2) + 4.0000000000000002e-9*std::exp(-100.0/tgas)*nden[1];
    f[1] = 1.7320508075688772e-9*std::pow(tgas, -0.5)*std::pow(nden[0], 2) - 2.0000000000000001e-9*std::exp(-100.0/tgas)*nden[1];
    // $JAFF END
}

// Analytic Jacobian J[i][j] = d f[i] / d nden[j]. Only the non-zero entries are
// generated; the rest stay zero from the clear loop.
inline void jacobian(const double* nden, double tgas, double** J) {
    for (int i = 0; i < NSPEC; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < NSPEC; ++j) J[i][j] = 0.0;
    // $JAFF REPEAT idx, expr IN jacobian
    J[0][0] = -6.9282032302755089e-9*std::pow(tgas, -0.5)*nden[0];
    J[0][1] = 4.0000000000000002e-9*std::exp(-100.0/tgas);
    J[1][0] = 3.4641016151377544e-9*std::pow(tgas, -0.5)*nden[0];
    J[1][1] = -2.0000000000000001e-9*std::exp(-100.0/tgas);
    // $JAFF END
}
```

Each `J[i][j]` is the partial derivative of `f[i]` with respect to
`nden[j]` — here all four entries are non-zero, but on a real network the
Jacobian is sparse and JAFF emits only the entries that survive differentiation.

## 4. The integrator

The following solver is **host-code infrastructure**. In a real hydro code this is the existing
ODE-integration layer that already lives in its own source files; here it is a
small backward-Euler step. Save it as `integrator.hpp`.

The integrator is **network-independent**: it names no species, takes the species
count `nspec` as a plain `int` argument, and works on `double**` matrices it
allocates at runtime. It never includes the generated header — it only needs the
RHS and Jacobian, which the driver hands it as function pointers. The same solver
drives a two-species toy and a thousand-species network without recompilation.

```cpp
// integrator.hpp — backward-Euler ODE integration infrastructure.
// Hand-written host code in its own file, the way a hydro code keeps its solver
// layer separate from the generated chemistry. It is network-independent: it
// names no species, takes the species count as an argument, and receives the
// RHS / Jacobian as function pointers.
#pragma once
#include <cmath>
#include <utility>
#include <vector>

// The RHS / Jacobian signatures the generated code provides.
using rhs_fn = void (*)(const double* nden, double tgas, double* f);
using jac_fn = void (*)(const double* nden, double tgas, double** J);

// Solve A x = b in place for an n-square system (Gaussian elimination with
// partial pivoting). A is a 2D matrix (A[i][j]) and n is passed in by the caller
// — the call shape a reusable solver layer exposes. b holds the solution.
inline void solve(int n, double** A, double* b) {
    for (int col = 0; col < n; ++col) {
        int piv = col;
        for (int r = col + 1; r < n; ++r)
            if (std::fabs(A[r][col]) > std::fabs(A[piv][col])) piv = r;
        for (int c = 0; c < n; ++c) std::swap(A[col][c], A[piv][c]);
        std::swap(b[col], b[piv]);
        for (int r = col + 1; r < n; ++r) {
            double m = A[r][col] / A[col][col];
            for (int c = col; c < n; ++c) A[r][c] -= m * A[col][c];
            b[r] -= m * b[col];
        }
    }
    for (int r = n - 1; r >= 0; --r) {
        double s = b[r];
        for (int c = r + 1; c < n; ++c) s -= A[r][c] * b[c];
        b[r] = s / A[r][r];
    }
}

// One implicit backward-Euler step of size dt: solve
// y_new - y - dt*f(y_new) = 0 for y_new by Newton iteration, where the Newton
// matrix is I - dt*J. nspec is supplied by the caller, not hardwired.
inline void backward_euler_step(int nspec, double* y, double tgas, double dt,
                                rhs_fn derivatives, jac_fn jacobian) {
    std::vector<double> yn(y, y + nspec), f(nspec), res(nspec);
    // Newton matrix G and Jacobian J as 2D arrays, exposed as double**.
    std::vector<std::vector<double>> Gstore(nspec, std::vector<double>(nspec));
    std::vector<std::vector<double>> Jstore(nspec, std::vector<double>(nspec));
    std::vector<double*> G(nspec), J(nspec);
    for (int i = 0; i < nspec; ++i) { G[i] = Gstore[i].data(); J[i] = Jstore[i].data(); }

    for (int it = 0; it < 8; ++it) {
        derivatives(yn.data(), tgas, f.data());
        jacobian(yn.data(), tgas, J.data());
        for (int i = 0; i < nspec; ++i) {
            res[i] = -(yn[i] - y[i] - dt * f[i]);
            for (int j = 0; j < nspec; ++j)
                G[i][j] = (i == j ? 1.0 : 0.0) - dt * J[i][j];
        }
        solve(nspec, G.data(), res.data());     // res <- Newton update
        double norm = 0.0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nspec; ++i) { yn[i] += res[i]; norm += std::fabs(res[i]); }
        if (norm < 1.0e-6) break;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < nspec; ++i) y[i] = yn[i];
}
```

`G` and `J` are `std::vector<double*>` views over per-row storage, so passing
`G.data()` / `J.data()` gives the `double**` the solver and the generated
`jacobian` expect, and every access stays plain 2D `A[i][j]` indexing. The
integrator receives the RHS and Jacobian as function pointers (`rhs_fn` /
`jac_fn`), so it calls them through their _signature_ rather than naming the
network's chemistry directly.

---

## 5. The driver

Finally, the host driver wires the two halves together: it `#include`s the
JAFF-generated header and the integrator, sets the initial conditions, and runs
the time loop. Save it as `main.cpp`.

```cpp
// main.cpp — the host driver: initial conditions, time loop, output.
// Hand-written host code. It includes the JAFF-generated RHS/Jacobian header and
// the integrator infrastructure, then wires the two together.
#include <cstdio>
#include "generated/chem_rhs.hpp"   // generated by JAFF: NSPEC, derivatives, jacobian
#include "integrator.hpp"           // host infrastructure: backward_euler_step

int main() {
    double nden[NSPEC] = {1.0e6, 0.0};   // start fully atomic: H, H2
    const double tgas = 3.0e2;           // 300 K
    const double dt   = 1.0e3;           // s
    const int    nsteps = 200;

    printf("%10s %12s %12s %14s\n", "t[s]", "n(H)", "n(H2)", "H_nuclei");
    for (int s = 0; s <= nsteps; ++s) {
        if (s % 40 == 0)
            printf("%10.0f %12.4e %12.4e %14.6e\n",
                   s*dt, nden[0], nden[1], nden[0] + 2*nden[1]);
        backward_euler_step(NSPEC, nden, tgas, dt, derivatives, jacobian);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

`NSPEC`, `derivatives`, and `jacobian` come from the generated header; the loop
and `backward_euler_step` come from the host. Re-running `jaffgen` after a
network change regenerates `generated/chem_rhs.hpp` in place and leaves
`integrator.hpp` and `main.cpp` untouched.

---

## 6. Compile and run

Compile the driver — it pulls in both headers — and run it:

```bash
g++ -O2 -std=c++17 main.cpp -o toy_solver
./toy_solver
```

```text
      t[s]         n(H)        n(H2)       H_nuclei
         0   1.0000e+06   0.0000e+00   1.000000e+06
     40000   1.1649e+05   4.4175e+05   1.000000e+06
     80000   6.0802e+04   4.6960e+05   1.000000e+06
    120000   4.1075e+04   4.7946e+05   1.000000e+06
    160000   3.1012e+04   4.8449e+05   1.000000e+06
    200000   2.4920e+04   4.8754e+05   1.000000e+06
```

The atomic hydrogen converts to H₂ and settles toward chemical equilibrium, and
the last column — total H nuclei, `n(H) + 2·n(H2)` — stays pinned at `1.0e6`,
the conservation check that says the integrator and the generated right-hand
side agree. Plotting every step makes the approach to equilibrium plain:

![Abundances of H and H₂ versus time, relaxing to chemical equilibrium](../../assets/toy_abundances_light.png#only-light){ width="640" }
![Abundances of H and H₂ versus time, relaxing to chemical equilibrium](../../assets/toy_abundances_dark.png#only-dark){ width="640" }

This split is the whole point of the workflow. The chemistry stays in the
network file, the solver infrastructure stays in your repo, and a single
`jaffgen` command keeps the generated RHS and Jacobian in sync with the network
— without ever editing the host code by hand.
