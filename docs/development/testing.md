# Testing

## Overview

JAFF uses pytest for testing. This guide covers how to run, write, and organize tests.

## Running Tests

The sections below collect the pytest invocations you'll use day to day.

### Basic Commands

Run the whole suite, or narrow down to a file, a single test, or a name pattern.

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_network_parsers.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_network_parsers.py::test_load_krome

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest -k "network"
```

### Coverage

Measure how much of `jaff` the suite exercises and generate a browsable report.

```bash
# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=jaff

# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=jaff --cov-report=html

# View report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### Markers

Markers let you select subsets of tests by category.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning "Markers"
    Markers have not yet been added to the suite. The commands below show the intended usage once markers are defined (see [Test Markers](#test-markers)).

```bash
# Run only fast tests
pytest -m "not slow"

# Run only slow tests
pytest -m slow

# Run only unit tests
pytest -m unit
```

## Test Organization

How the `tests/` directory is laid out and how individual test files are structured.

### Directory Structure

Tests live in a flat `tests/` directory, one file per area, with sample network
files under `tests/fixtures/`:

```
tests/
├── __init__.py
├── test_network_initialization.py   # Network construction
├── test_network_parsers.py          # Multi-format parsing (KROME, KIDA, …)
├── test_network_validation.py       # Duplicate / sink / isomer checks
├── test_network_edge_cases.py       # Empty / malformed networks
├── test_network_json.py             # .jaff round-trip
├── test_sympy_json.py               # SymPy ↔ JSON encoding

    ├── sample_krome.dat
    ├── sample_kida.dat
    ├── sample_kida_valid.dat        # + sample_kida_valid.jfunc
    ├── sample_prizmo.dat
    ├── sample_uclchem.dat
    ├── sample_udfa.dat
    ├── empty_network.dat
    ├── malformed_network.dat
    ├── test_cse.dat
    ├── test_jac.dat
    └── test_jac_dedt.dat            # + test_jac_dedt.jfunc
```

### Test File Structure

Group related tests into `Test<Subject>` classes with descriptive method names.

```python
"""Tests for Network parsing."""

import pytest
from jaff import Network


class TestNetwork:
    """Network class tests."""

    def test_load_basic_network(self):
        """Test loading a basic network."""
        net = Network("tests/fixtures/sample_krome.dat")
        assert len(net.species) > 0
        assert len(net.reactions) > 0

    def test_load_krome_format(self):
        """Test loading KROME format."""
        net = Network("tests/fixtures/sample_krome.dat")
        assert net.label is not None


class TestNetworkValidation:
    """Network validation tests."""

    def test_duplicate_reactions(self):
        """Test detection of duplicate reactions."""
        # Test implementation
        pass
```

## Writing Tests

Patterns for the most common kinds of test, from a plain assertion to parametrized cases.

### Basic Test

The simplest test loads a fixture and asserts on the resulting object.

```python
def test_network_species_count():
    """Test species are loaded."""
    net = Network("tests/fixtures/sample_krome.dat")
    assert len(net.species) > 0
    assert net.species.count == len(net.species)
```

### Testing Exceptions

Use `pytest.raises` to assert that bad input fails the way you expect.

```python
from jaff.errors import ParserError


def test_missing_file_raises_error():
    """Test that a missing file raises FileNotFoundError."""
    with pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError):
        Network("nonexistent.dat")

def test_malformed_network_raises_error():
    """Test that a malformed network raises a ParserError."""
    with pytest.raises(ParserError):
        Network("tests/fixtures/malformed_network.dat")
```

### Parametrized Tests

Run the same test body over many inputs with `@pytest.mark.parametrize`.

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("lang,expected_bracket", [
    ("c++", "["),
    ("c", "["),
    ("fortran", "("),
    ("python", "["),
])
def test_codegen_brackets(lang, expected_bracket):
    """Test bracket style for each language."""
    net = Network("tests/fixtures/sample_krome.dat")
    cg = Codegen(network=net, lang=lang)
    assert cg.lb == expected_bracket
```

### Parametrized with Multiple Arguments

Parametrize over several arguments at once to cover a matrix of cases.

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("filename,expected_species,expected_reactions", [
    ("sample_krome.dat", 10, 20),
    ("sample_kida.dat", 50, 100),
])
def test_network_sizes(filename, expected_species, expected_reactions):
    """Test networks load with expected sizes (counts are illustrative)."""
    net = Network(f"tests/fixtures/{filename}")
    assert len(net.species) == expected_species
    assert len(net.reactions) == expected_reactions
```

## Fixtures

Fixtures provide reusable setup. Define shared fixtures in a `conftest.py`, or
inline in the test module that uses them.

### Basic Fixtures

A fixture returns a prepared object that any test can request by name.

```python
# conftest.py
import pytest
from jaff import Network

@pytest.fixture
def small_network():
    """Small test network."""
    return Network("tests/fixtures/sample_krome.dat")

@pytest.fixture
def codegen_cpp(small_network):
    """C++ code generator for the small network."""
    from jaff import Codegen
    return Codegen(network=small_network, lang="c++")
```

### Using Fixtures

Request a fixture by adding its name as a test argument.

```python
def test_with_fixture(small_network):
    """Test using the network fixture."""
    assert len(small_network.species) > 0

def test_code_generation(codegen_cpp):
    """Test rate code generation."""
    rates = codegen_cpp.get_rates_str(use_cse=True)
    assert "k[0]" in rates
```

### Fixture Scope

Control how often a fixture is rebuilt with `scope` — reuse expensive setup
across a module, or get a fresh instance per test.

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def expensive_network():
    """Module-scoped fixture for expensive setup (loaded once per module)."""
    return Network("tests/fixtures/sample_kida.dat")

@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def temp_directory(tmp_path):
    """Function-scoped temporary directory (new for each test)."""
    return tmp_path
```

## Test Data

Where test inputs come from and how to create throwaway files.

### Creating Test Networks

Fixture network files are small plain-text reaction lists checked into `tests/fixtures/`.

```python
# tests/fixtures/sample_krome.dat
H + O -> OH, 1.2e-10 * (tgas/300)**0.5
H2 + O -> OH + H, 3.4e-11 * exp(-500/tgas)
C + O2 -> CO + O, 5.6e-12
```

### Using Temporary Files

Use pytest's `tmp_path` fixture for files a test writes and reads back.

```python
def test_network_save_load(tmp_path):
    """Test saving and loading a network."""
    # Create network
    net = Network("tests/fixtures/sample_krome.dat")

    # Save to a temporary .jaff file
    output_file = tmp_path / "test.jaff"
    net.to_jaff(output_file)

    # Load and verify
    net2 = Network(str(output_file))
    assert len(net2.species) == len(net.species)
```

## Mocking

Replace real dependencies with stand-ins to isolate the code under test.

### Mock External Dependencies

Patch I/O and other externals so tests don't touch the real filesystem.

```python
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

def test_with_mock():
    """Test with a mocked open()."""
    with patch("builtins.open") as mock_open:
        mock_open.return_value.__enter__.return_value.readlines.return_value = [
            "H + O -> OH, 1.2e-10\n"
        ]
        # Test code
```

### Mock Network Loading

Build a `Mock(spec=Network)` when a test only needs a stand-in network.

```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_network():
    """Mock network for testing."""
    net = Mock(spec=Network)
    net.species = [Mock(name="H"), Mock(name="O")]
    net.reactions = [Mock()]
    return net

def test_with_mock_network(mock_network):
    """Test using the mocked network."""
    assert len(mock_network.species) == 2
```

## Testing Best Practices

Habits that keep the suite readable and useful.

### 1. Test One Thing at a Time

Each test should verify a single behaviour so failures point to one cause.

```python
# Good
def test_network_loads_successfully():
    """Test network loads without error."""
    net = Network("tests/fixtures/sample_krome.dat")
    assert net is not None

def test_network_has_species():
    """Test network has species."""
    net = Network("tests/fixtures/sample_krome.dat")
    assert len(net.species) > 0

# Avoid
def test_everything():
    """Test everything at once."""
    net = Network("tests/fixtures/sample_krome.dat")
    assert net is not None
    assert len(net.species) > 0
    # ... many more assertions
```

### 2. Use Descriptive Names

Name the test after the behaviour it checks.

```python
# Good
def test_codegen_raises_error_for_unsupported_language():
    """Test that an unsupported language raises ValueError."""
    pass

# Avoid
def test_lang():
    pass
```

### 3. Test Edge Cases

Cover the boundaries — empty, single-element, and duplicate inputs.

```python
def test_empty_network():
    """Test handling of an empty network."""
    pass

def test_network_with_one_species():
    """Test a network with a single species."""
    pass

def test_network_with_duplicate_species():
    """Test handling of duplicate species."""
    pass
```

### 4. Test Error Conditions

Assert that invalid input raises the right exception.

```python
def test_file_not_found():
    """Test FileNotFoundError for a missing file."""
    with pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError):
        Network("nonexistent.dat")

def test_invalid_format():
    """Test ParserError for an invalid format."""
    from jaff.errors import ParserError
    with pytest.raises(ParserError):
        Network("tests/fixtures/malformed_network.dat")
```

## Integration Tests

Exercise several components together to confirm a full workflow holds up.

### Testing Complete Workflows

This test drives the whole path: load a network, generate code, write it out, verify.

```python
def test_complete_code_generation_workflow(tmp_path):
    """Test the complete workflow from network to code."""
    # Load network
    net = Network("tests/fixtures/sample_krome.dat")

    # Create code generator
    cg = Codegen(network=net, lang="c++")

    # Generate code
    rates = cg.get_rates_str(use_cse=True)
    odes = cg.get_ode_str(use_cse=True)

    # Save to file
    output_file = tmp_path / "chemistry.cpp"
    with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        f.write(rates)
        f.write("\n\n")
        f.write(odes)

    # Verify file exists and has content
    assert output_file.exists()
    content = output_file.read_text()
    assert "k[0]" in content
    assert "f[0]" in content
```

## Performance Tests

Guard against regressions in speed and memory. Mark these `slow` so they can be skipped.

### Timing Tests

Assert that an operation finishes within a time budget.

```python
import time

@pytest.mark.slow
def test_large_network_performance():
    """Test that a large network loads in reasonable time."""
    start = time.time()
    net = Network("tests/fixtures/sample_kida.dat")
    duration = time.time() - start

    assert duration < 30.0  # Should load in < 30 seconds
```

### Memory Tests

Track peak allocation with `tracemalloc` and assert an upper bound.

```python
import tracemalloc

@pytest.mark.slow
def test_memory_usage():
    """Test that memory usage stays reasonable."""
    tracemalloc.start()

    net = Network("tests/fixtures/sample_krome.dat")
    cg = Codegen(network=net, lang="c++")
    rates = cg.get_rates_str(use_cse=True)

    current, peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()
    tracemalloc.stop()

    # Peak memory should be reasonable
    assert peak < 100 * 1024 * 1024  # < 100 MB
```

## Continuous Integration

The **Tests** workflow runs `pytest` (with coverage) on every push and pull
request to `main`, across Linux, macOS, and Windows on Python 3.11, 3.12, and
3.13, and uploads coverage to Codecov. Two further workflows build the docs and
execute the example notebooks.

For the full list of CI workflows and what each one gates, see the
[Contributing Guide](contributing.md#5-pass-ci).

## Coverage Goals

Target coverage levels for the suite:

- **Overall coverage**: > 80%
- **Critical modules**: > 90%
- **New code**: 100% coverage required

### Check Coverage

Use `--cov-report=term-missing` to see exactly which lines are untested.

```bash
# Show untested lines in the terminal
pytest --cov=jaff --cov-report=term-missing

# Generate a browsable HTML report
pytest --cov=jaff --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## Troubleshooting Tests

Flags and techniques for diagnosing failing tests.

### Test Failures

Increase verbosity, surface prints, or stop early to zero in on a failure.

```bash
# Run with detailed output
pytest -vv

# Show print statements
pytest -s

# Stop at first failure
pytest -x

# Run last failed tests
pytest --lf
```

### Debugging Tests

Drop into a debugger at the point of interest.

```python
def test_debug_example():
    """Test with a debugger breakpoint."""
    net = Network("tests/fixtures/sample_krome.dat")

    # Built-in breakpoint (Python 3.7+)
    breakpoint()

    assert len(net.species) > 0
```

## Test Markers

Markers tag tests so they can be selected or skipped as a group.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning "Markers"
    Markers are not yet defined in `pyproject.toml`. The snippets below show how they will be configured and used once added.

### Defining Markers

Register markers under `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` in `pyproject.toml`.

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
markers = [
    "slow: marks tests as slow",
    "unit: unit tests",
    "integration: integration tests",
    "network: network-related tests",
]
```

### Using Markers

Apply markers with the `@pytest.mark.<name>` decorator; multiple markers stack.

```python
@pytest.mark.slow
def test_large_network():
    """Slow test."""
    pass

@pytest.mark.unit
def test_species_creation():
    """Unit test."""
    pass

@pytest.mark.integration
@pytest.mark.network
def test_full_workflow():
    """Integration test for the network workflow."""
    pass
```
