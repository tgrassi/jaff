## Using JAFF in Your Project

### Attribution

When using JAFF in your project, please include:

1. **The MIT License text** (shown above)
2. **Copyright notice**: "Copyright 2025 Jaff Contributors"

You can include this in:

- Your project's LICENSE file
- A THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES file
- Your software's about/credits section
- Your documentation

### Example Attribution

**In a LICENSE or THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES file:**

```text
This project uses JAFF (Just Another Fancy Format):

Copyright 2025 Jaff Contributors
Licensed under the MIT License
https://github.com/jaff-chemistry/jaff
```

**In source code:**

```cpp
/*
 * This code was generated using JAFF
 * Copyright 2025 Jaff Contributors
 * Licensed under the MIT License
 * https://github.com/jaff-chemistry/jaff
 */
```

## Generated Code

The chemistry-specific output JAFF produces from *your* network — the rate, ODE,
and Jacobian expressions — is your work, and you may license it however you choose,
including in proprietary software.

The caveat is **bundled template code**: JAFF ships solver templates (under
`src/jaff/templates/`) that are themselves MIT-licensed, and some generated files
incorporate that template code. Where your output contains JAFF template code, that
portion remains under the MIT License and its copyright/permission notice should be
retained.

**Practical guidance:**

- [x] The generated equations derived from your network are yours to license.
- [x] Retain the MIT notice for any bundled template code included in the output.
- [x] Attribution to JAFF for the equation output is appreciated but not required.

!!! note
    This is a plain-language summary, not legal advice. The [MIT License](#mit-license)
    text above governs; consult a professional for specific licensing questions.
