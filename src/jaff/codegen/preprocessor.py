"""Template pre-processor for JAFF code-generation output files.

This module provides :class:`Preprocessor`, which walks a directory of
template source files and replaces ``!! PREPROCESS_KEY`` / ``!! PREPROCESS_END``
marker pairs with generated code strings supplied by the caller.

Workflow
--------
1. :class:`~jaff.codegen.codegen.Codegen` (or a plugin's ``main()`` function)
   produces code strings for rates, fluxes, ODEs, Jacobians, etc.
2. Those strings are collected into a ``dict[str, str]`` keyed by the
   ``PREPROCESS_KEY`` names that appear in the template files.
3. :meth:`Preprocessor.preprocess` (or :meth:`Preprocessor.preprocess_file`)
   is called with the template directory, file list, and the dictionary.
4. Each template file is scanned line-by-line.  When a marker line is found
   the corresponding generated code is inserted immediately after the marker,
   preserving the indentation of the marker line.
5. Any non-template files in the source directory are copied verbatim to the
   build directory.

Marker syntax (example for Fortran ``!!`` comment style)::

    !! PREPROCESS_RATES
    !! PREPROCESS_END

After preprocessing::

    !! PREPROCESS_RATES
    k(0) = 1.0d-10 * exp(-100.0d0 / tgas)
    k(1) = 2.5d-11

    !! PREPROCESS_END

        Scans the file line by line.  When a line matching

        Indentation of the marker line is propagated to every line of the
