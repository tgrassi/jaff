"""
Fast log2 approximation and its numerical inverse.

The algorithm is adapted from the quokka radiation-hydrodynamics code
(https://github.com/quokka-astro/quokka/) and is designed to produce a
*uniform-in-fast_log2* temperature grid for rate-coefficient tables so that
the runtime table-lookup in quokka can use the same cheap approximation
instead of a transcendental ``log2`` call.

The approximation
-----------------
For any positive float *x* decomposed by :func:`numpy.frexp` as::

    x = mantissa * 2^exponent,   mantissa ∈ [0.5, 1.0)

the fast log2 is defined as::

    fast_log2(x) = 2 * (mantissa - 1) + exponent

This is a piecewise-linear approximation to the true ``log2`` that is exact
at every power of 2 and has a maximum absolute error of about 0.086 bits.

def fast_log2(x):
    """
    Compute a fast piecewise-linear approximation to log2(*x*).

    Uses the :func:`numpy.frexp` mantissa/exponent decomposition to evaluate::

        fast_log2(x) = 2 * (mantissa - 1) + exponent

    This expression is exact at every power of two and continuous everywhere,
    but deviates from the true log2 by at most ~0.086 in the worst case
    (at the midpoints between consecutive powers of two).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input value(s).  Must be positive; non-positive values map to ``NaN``.

    Returns
    -------
    float or numpy.ndarray
        Approximated log2 value(s).  Returns a scalar when *x* is scalar,
        an array otherwise.

    Notes
    -----
    The approximation is designed so that a uniform grid in ``fast_log2``
    space can be reconstructed at runtime using the same cheap operation,
    avoiding a transcendental ``log2`` call in inner loops.

def inverse_fast_log2(y):
    """
    Compute the numerical inverse of :func:`fast_log2` to near machine precision.

    For each element of *y* the function finds *x* such that
    ``fast_log2(x) == y`` using Brent's root-finding method, starting from
    the initial bracket ``[0.5 * 2^y, 2.0 * 2^y]`` (which safely brackets
    the root because :func:`fast_log2` is strictly monotone).  If Brent's
    method leaves a residual above the target tolerance, up to five Newton
    polishing steps are applied using the derivative::

        d(fast_log2)/dx ≈ 1 / (x * ln(2))

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : array_like
        Target fast_log2 value(s) to invert.

    Returns
    -------
    float or numpy.ndarray
        The *x* value(s) satisfying ``fast_log2(x) ≈ y``.  Returns a
        scalar when *y* is scalar, an array otherwise.

    Notes
    -----
    The tolerance goal is ``20 * eps * |y|`` where ``eps`` is double
    machine epsilon (~2.2e-16).  A warning is printed to stdout if the
    residual cannot be reduced below this threshold after all polishing
    steps -- this should not occur in normal use.
